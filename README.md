This project evolved in to a mobile component. It can only be view on you mobile (https://stuntdouble.nelify.com).
My challenge was to see if I could create a 'swipe-like' component from scratch. Initially this was given to me as a tech test but I was allowed to use a npm component to 'create' the swipe component. I wanted to see if I could create the component from scratch without any npm modules doing the heavy lifting.
