# StuntDouble


This project can be view here [Stuntdouble](https://stuntdouble.netlify.com).

This project has evolved in to a mobile component. It can only be view on your mobile (https://stuntdouble.nelify.com).
My challenge was to see if I could create a 'swipe-like' component from scratch. Initially this was given to me as a tech test but I was allowed to use a npm component to 'create' the swipe component. I wanted to see if I could create the component from scratch without any npm modules doing the heavy lifting. 

You have a group of stunt double canidates, you choose to either swipe right to 'like' or left to 'dislike'
